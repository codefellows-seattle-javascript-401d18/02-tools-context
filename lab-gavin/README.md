# Gavin Thomas' Lab - 02 #
## Here I have demonstrated what some common Javascript functions look like under the hood! So you may never take them for granted again. ##

## myMap function iterates through an array and allows a user to use the call() to a function to that array ##

## myFilter function also iterates through an array and allows a user to use the call() to a function to that array ##

## myConcat function iterates through two arrays and concatenates them together. ##

## myMap function iterates through an array and allows a user to call a function to that array ##

## myReduce function iterates through an array of numbers and combines them into one number. ##




### I did two tests per function. One if a user doesn't input an array and another to test whether the math works. ###
