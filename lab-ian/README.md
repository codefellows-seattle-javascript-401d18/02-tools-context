# Code Fellows 401 Advanced JavaScript - Lab 2
## Tools and Context

This lab was to give us an understanding of how to incorporate TDD into our programming.

We were assigned the task to demonstrate our knowledge of JavaScripts array methods and test them using Jest to see if they are returning the expected result.

To run the tests:
1. Clone the repo!
3. Navigate to the lab-ian folder
2. Run 'npm install' to install the dependencies
3. Run 'npm test' to see the results of the methods!
