# Lab2 Docs:

All files & folders I added to this lab are under the folder lab-isaiah.

Included the following required files and folders:
- README.md (this file)
- .gitignore (as provided)
- .eslintrc (as provided)
- lib/ (contains fp.js)
- test/ (contains fp.test.js)
- Also included package.json & node_modules

Created stand alone functions for `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `concat`, and `splice` using the `call` and `apply` methods. Implemented ES6 arrow function syntax for all functions.

Created Tests to fail first, then adjusted to pass. Modified test/functions to insure tests were sound and appropriate.

Created index.js for attempt at bonus points but did not proceed any further. If completed before due will resubmit for bonus point.
