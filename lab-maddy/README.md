## Practice using .map, .filter, .reduce, .concat, .splice with tests

This lab was all about using the above stand alone functions with test arrays and simple math problems that we made up. We will write real code to test these functions later in the week.

Some key steps that I wanted to keep track of are (and could be a bit incorrect):
1. npm init
2. npm install -D jest
3. install eslint and then added it to my package.json
