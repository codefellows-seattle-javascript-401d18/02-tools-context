# Lab 2


create a lint script for running eslint
create a lib/fp.js file for holding the following:
create stand alone map, filter, reduce, concat, and splice functions using the call, and apply methods we discussed today
you are welcome to use/experiment with bind too!
note: - all functions should be created using the es6 lexical arrow function syntax
Tests

create a test for each of your custom functions in lib/fp.js
note - feel free to create additional tests, if you choose!
Bonus 2pts

create a CLI (index.js) that will use your new map function to uppercase all command line arguments and print them to the screen: 1pt
hint: - you'll want to check out the process object (and it's methods) to get an array of provided command line arguments
test your CLI: 1pt
