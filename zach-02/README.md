In the fp.js file, there are 5 methods that can be used. They were all created using the .call and .apply methods.

The fp.mapDeal method can be called to run the map method. In the test file, this is used to multiply all indexes by 2.

The fp.filterDeal functions exactly like the .filter method. See MDN docs below.

The fp.reduceDeal functions the same as the .reduce method. See MDN docs below.

The fp.concatDeal functions the same as the .concat method. See MDN docs below.

The fp.spliceDeal functions the same as the .splice method. See MDN docs below.
